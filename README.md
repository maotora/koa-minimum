## Koa bare minimum.

A boilerplate project for most packages I need to make a fast start with my
koa@next development.

#### Install

    npm install

#### Babelify

    npm run build:watch

#### Start Server

    npm run build:start

#### Watch tests

    npm run test:watch

#### Test route

With [httpie](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie/)

    http localhost:1337

Or with curl (°ロ°)☝

    curl http://localhost:1337

### Contribution.

I accept contribution, issues and PRs even for a boilerplate project, so if you
think I'm doing something funny (as always), please give feedback.

**Peace!**
