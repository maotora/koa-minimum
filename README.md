## Koa bare minimum.

A boilerplate project for most packages I need to make a fast start with my
koa@next development.

### Packages Included.

For anyone's convinience here is a list of packages so you won't have to read
my `package.json` file just to see them.

#### Dev Dependencies

```js
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-cli": "^6.23.0",
    "babel-core": "^6.23.1",
    "babel-preset-latest": "^6.22.0",
    "babel-preset-stage-0": "^6.22.0",
    "babel-register": "^6.23.0",
    "chai": "^3.5.0",
    "mocha": "^3.2.0",
    "sqlite3": "^3.1.8",
    "supertest": "^3.0.0"
  }
```

#### Dependencies (Production Deps)

```js
  "dependencies": {
    "babel-polyfill": "^6.23.0",
    "bluebird": "^3.4.7",
    "bookshelf": "^0.10.3",
    "dotenv": "^4.0.0",
    "knex": "^0.12.7",
    "koa": "^2.0.0-alpha.8",
    "koa-better-body": "^3.0.2",
    "koa-convert": "^1.2.0",
    "koa-rest-router": "^1.0.1",
    "lodash": "^4.17.4",
    "nodemon": "^1.11.0",
    "pg": "^6.1.2"
  },
```

I thought I should include the version too and will consider updating it as if
I happen to update the packages.

### Contribution.

I accept contribution, issues and PRs even for a boilerplate project, so if you
think I'm doing something silly (as always), please give feedback.

**Peace!**
